> From their [README.md](https://github.com/treflehq/trefle-api/blob/master/README.md): _We didn't got the time or the means to keep the Trefle API online any longer, so after spending months figuring out a solution, we decided to stop there. It has been a great adventure, and we are forever grateful for your support and feedback :pray:_

[Trefle](https://trefle.io/) API Wrapper for Elixir, built for ease of use, with some cool helper methods to easily handle pagination. Currently supports Trefle on v1.6.0.

## Installation üíª

The package can be installed by adding `trifolium` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:trifolium, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

The docs can be found on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm/trifolium).

## Usage ‚å®Ô∏è

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Trefle
  alias Trifolium.Endpoints.Plants

  def get_plant(id) do
    Plants.find(id)
  end

  def search_umid_plants(query) do
    Plants.search(q: query, filter: %{umidity: "20, 50"})
    # You could use umidity as an array and we would parse it
  end
end
```

For pagination you can use:

```elixir
defmodule YourApp.Trefle
  alias Trifolium.Endpoints.Plants

  def get_two_plants_pages(page) do
    page_1 = Plants.all(page: page)
    next_page = Trifolium.Navigation.next(page_1)

    {page_1, next_page}
  end
end
```

For every available method, please check [our documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/trifolium) on HexDocs.
